##  A brief Description of some of the Algorithms we used
##

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
###
SVD is a type of dimensionality reduction technique used to build and optimize recommender systems used by top companies like Amazon, Netflix, Apple e.t.c. It's a Matrix Factorization-based algorithm. It has some interesting algebraic properties and conveys important geometrical and theoretical insights about linear transformations.
###

### K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
###
K-Nearest Neighbors is a machine learning technique and algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. K-Nearest Neighbors examines the labels of a chosen number of data points surrounding a target data point, in order to make a prediction about the class that the data point falls into.
###

### Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
###
NMF is a collaborative filtering algorithm based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization. It is very similar with SVD and specialises in good clustering. It can be useful when refining results gotten from recommender systems. It can also be applied on other data science processes and produces really incredible results.
