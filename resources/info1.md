###  How it works

This app requires the user to choose 3 movies
(ideally his/her favourite movies) from a list of movies, and will
recommend 10 movies that'll closely match the users choices.

###
The user will have the choice of using 
either the "Content-Based" or the "Collaborative-Based" filtering algorithms to get their recommendations. 
Content-based filtering uses similarities between movies based on their properties, while collaborative-based filtering uses similarities amongst users to drive recommendations.
