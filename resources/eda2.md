### No. of Movie ratings per user
###
##### This graph shows that the total number of movies rated by each user is between 0 - 500. We can clearly see from the drop-off that a lot of users did not rate up to 200 movies.

##### This can affect the Collaborative-Based filtering algorithm, as there won't be adequate information from those users to make accurate recommendations.
##### We found a way to trim it down, without loosing much data:wink:.
